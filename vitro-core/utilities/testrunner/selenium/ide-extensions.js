 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * ide-extensions.js
 *
 * Vivo-specific modifications to ßSelenium IDE (1.0.4). 
 *
 * As delivered, the HTML formatter writes comments as actual HTML comments, 
 * so they are invisible when the test file is viewed in a browser.
 *
 * These modifications will change the options in the HTML formatter, so:
 * 1) When writing an HTML test file, comments are written as "comment" 
 *    commands, where the text of the comment is the target of the command.
 * 2) When reading an HTML test file, "comment" commands are parsed as 
 *    comments, so they can be recognized by the IDE editor. Old-style 
 *    comments will also be recognized, for compatibility.
 * 3) When writing an HTML test file, a CSS stylesheet is embedded in the 
 *    heading with styles for the test name and the comments. Class attributes 
 *    are inserted in the test name cell and the comment text cell to apply
 *    these styles.
 *
 * Tests written using these mods must have access to "user-extensions.js" 
 * when running, either in the IDE or in Selenium RC. That file will define
 * "comment" as a command that does nothing.
 *
 * To install these mods in Selenium IDE:
 * 1) Start the IDE.
 * 2) Go the "Options" menu and select "Options..."
 * 3) Put the path to "user-extensions.js into the 
 *    "Selenium core extensions" field.
 * 4) Put the path to this file "ide-extensions.js" into the 
 *    "Selenium IDE extensions" field.
 * 5) Close the IDE and re-start it.
