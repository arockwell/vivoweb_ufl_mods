<#-- Template for home page body contents. This file is deliberately empty, for use by themes that define a full
page template for the home page and do not use a separate body template. The HomePageController defines a 
body template, for those themes that do not use a distinct page template for the home page, so that they
can provide the home page body content. The default empty template is defined so Freemarker doesn't throw an error
when it tries to get the template. (Or should we just let Freemarker log an error? It doesn't prevent the page
from displaying.) -->
