<h2>Change Namespace of Resources</h2>

<p>This tool will change all resources in the supplied "old namespace" 
to be in the "new namespace."  Additionally, the local names will be updated
to follow the established "n" + random integer naming convention.</p>

<p>This tool operates on the main web application model only, not on any 
   of the additional Jena models.</p>

<form id="takeuri" action="ingest" method="get">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="renameResource"/>

<p>New Namespace  <input id="uri2" type="text" size="52" name="uri2"/></p>
