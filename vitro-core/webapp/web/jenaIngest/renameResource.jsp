<h2><a class="ingestMenu" href="ingest">Ingest Menu</a> > Change Namespace of Resources</h2>

<p>This tool will change all resources in the supplied "old namespace" 
to be in the "new namespace."  Additionally, the local names will be updated
to follow the established "n" + random integer naming convention.</p>

<p>This tool operates on the main web application model only, not on any 
   of the additional Jena models.</p>
