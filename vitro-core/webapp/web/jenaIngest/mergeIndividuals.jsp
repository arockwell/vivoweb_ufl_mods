<h2>Merge Individuals</h2>

<p>This tool allows two individuals with different URIs to be collapsed into a 
   single URI.  Any statements using the "duplicate individual URI" will be 
   rewritten using the "primary individual URI."  If there are multiple 
   statements for a property that can have only a single value, the extra
   statements will be retracted from the model and offered for download.</p>
<p>This tool operates on the main web application model only, not on any 
   of the additional Jena models.</p>
