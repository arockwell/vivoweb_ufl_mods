/**
 * <p>
 * Clean up any files that are stored in the old directory structure and
 * referenced by old-style image properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Besides converting the files to the new framework, this process will produce
 * these artifacts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A log file in the uploaded files directory, with a timestamped name, such
 * as <code>upgrade/upgradeLog2010-06-20T14-55-00.txt</code>, for example. If
 * for any reason, the upgrade process must run again, the log will not be
 * overwritten.</li>
 * <li>A directory of "deleted" files - these were extra thumbnail files or
 * extra main image files -- see the details below.</li>
 * <li>A directory of "unreferenced" files - these were in the image directory,
 * but not connected to any entity.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We consider some special cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An individual may refer to an image file that does not actually exist. If
 * so, that reference will be deleted.</li>
 * <li>There may be more than one reference to the same image file. If so, all
 * but the first such reference will be deleted.</li>
 * <li>
 * In the old style, it was possible to have a main image without a thumbnail.
 * If we find that, we will generate a scaled down copy of the main image, store
 * that as a thumbnail image file, and then proceed.</li>
 * <li>
 * In the old style, it was possible to have a thumbnail without a main image.
 * If we find that, we will make a copy of the thumbnail image file, declare
 * that copy to be the main image, and then proceed.</li>
 * <li>
 * We may find individuals with more than one main image, or more than one
 * thumbnail. If so, we will discard all but the first one (move them to the
 * "deleted" directory).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Aside from these special cases, we will:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Translate the main image.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Store the image in the new file system.</li>
 * <li>Delete the image from the old images directory.</li>
 * <li>Create a ByteStream individual for the main image.</li>
 * <li>Create a Surrogate individual for the main image.</li>
 * <li>Tie these together and attach to the entity that owns the image.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Translate the thumbnail.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Store the thumbnail in the new file system.</li>
 * <li>Create a ByteStream individual for the thumbnail.</li>
 * <li>Create a Surrogate individual for the thumbnail.</li>
 * <li>Tie these together and attach to the Surrogate for the main image.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After processing all of these cases, there may be some images remaining in
 * the "images" directory. These will be moved to the "unreferenced" directory,
 * while preserving any internal tree structure.
 * </p>
