following text from http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Capitalize/Capitalize.pm

This web page:
  http://www.continentallocating.com/World.Literature/General2/LiteraryTitles2.htm

presents some admirably clear rules for capitalizing titles:
  ALL words in EVERY title are capitalized except
  (1) a, an, and the,
  (2) two and three letter conjunctions (and, or, nor, for, but, so, yet),
  (3) prepositions.
  Exceptions:  The first and last words are always capitalized even
  if they are among the above three groups.

But consider the case:
  "It Waits Underneath the Sea"

Should the word "underneath" be downcased because it's a preposition? Most English speakers
would be surprised to see it that way. Consequently, the default list of exceptions to
capitalization in this module only includes the shortest of the common prepositions
(to of by at for but in).

The default entries on the exception list are:
     a an the
     and or nor for but so yet
     to of by at for but in with has
     de von
The observant may note that the last row is not composed of English words. The honorary
"de" has been included in honor of "HonorÃ© de Balzac". And "von" was added for the sake
of equal time.
