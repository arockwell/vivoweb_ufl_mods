/**
 * <p>
 * The code in this package implements the Vitro file-storage system.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Relationship to PairTree</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The system incorporates a number of ideas from the PairTree specification, 
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>
 *       The basic pairtree algorithm – 
 *       mapping an encoded identifier string into a filesystem directory path.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       Identifier string cleaning – 
 *       encoding identifiers in a two-step process so that all illegal 
 *       characters are eliminated, but some commonly-used 
 *       illegal characters are handled by simple substitution.
 *       Actually, it becomes a three-step process because namespaces are 
 *       invoved.
 *     </li>
 *   </ul> 
 * but is different in several respects:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>
 *       Each "object" will consist only of a single file, 
 *       causing the entire issue of object encapsulation to be moot.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       Filenames will be cleaned in the same manner as identifiers, 
 *       guarding against illegal characters in filenames.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       Character encoding will include backslashes, 
 *       for compatibility with Windows.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       Character encoding will include tildes, to allow for "namespaces". 
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       A namespace/prefix capability will be used to shorten file paths, 
 *       but with more flexibility than the prefix algorithm given in the specification.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       "shorty" directory names may be up to 3 characters long, not 2.
 *     </li>
 *   </ul> 
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Directory structure</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 *   A typical structure would look like this:
 *   <pre>
 *   + basedir
 *   |
 *   +--+ file_storage_namespaces.properties
 *   |
 *   +--+ file_storage_root
 *   </pre>
 *   The <code>file_storage_root</code> directory contains the subdirectories 
 *   that implement the encoded IDs, and the final directory for each ID will 
 *   contain a single file that corresponds to that ID. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Namespaces</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 *   To reduce the length of the file paths, the system will can be initialized
 *   to recognize certain sets of characters (loosely termed "namespaces") and
 *   to replace them with a given prefix and separator character during ID 
 *   encoding. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   For example, the sytem might be initialized with a "namespace" of 
 *   "http://vivo.mydomain.edu/file/". If that is the only namespace, it will
 *   be internally assigned a prefix of "a", so a URI like this:
 *   <pre>http://vivo.mydomain.edu/file/n3424/myPhoto.jpg</pre>
 *   would be converted to this:
 *   <pre>a~n3424/myPhoto.jpg</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The namespaces and their assigned prefixes are stored in a properties file 
 *   when the structure is initialized. When the structure is re-opened, the
 *   file is read to find the correct prefixes. The file
 *   might look like this:
 *   <pre>
 *     a = http://the.first.namespace/
 *     b = http://the.second.namespace/
 *   </pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>ID encoding</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 *   This is a multi-step process:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>
 *       <strong>Namespace recognition</strong> -
 *       If the ID begins with a recognized namespace, then that namespace is 
 *       stripped from the ID, and the prefix associated with that namespace 
 *       is set aside for later in the process.
 *     </li> 
 *     <li>
 *       <strong>Rare character encoding</strong> -
 *       Illegal characters are translated to their hexadecimal equivalents, 
 *       as are some rarely used characters which will be given other 
 *       purposes later in the process. The translated characters include any
 *       octet outside of the visible ASCII range (21-7e), and these additional
 *       characters: 
 *       <pre> " * + , &lt; = &gt; ? ^ | \ ~ </pre>
 *       The hexadecimal encoding consists of a caret followed by 2 hex digits, 
 *       e.g.: ^7C
 *     </li> 
 *     <li>
 *       <strong>Common character encoding</strong> -
 *       To keep the file paths short and readable, characters that are used
 *       commonly in IDs but may be illegal in the file system are translated
 *       to a single, lesser-used character.
 *       <ul>
 *         <li> / becomes = </li> 
 *         <li> : becomes + </li> 
 *         <li> . becomes , </li> 
 *       </ul>
 *     </li> 
 *     <li>
 *       <strong>Prefixing</strong> -
 *       If a namespace was recognized on the ID in the first step, the 
 *       associated prefix letter will be prepended to the string, with a 
 *       tilde separator.
 *     </li> 
 *     <li>
 *       <strong>Path breakdown</strong> -
 *       Path separator characters are inserted after every third character 
 *       in the processed ID string.
 *     </li> 
 *     <li>
 *       <strong>Exclusion of reserved Windows filenames</strong> -
 *       Windows will not permit certain specific filename or directory names,
 *       so if any part of the path would be equal to one of those reserved
 *       names, it is prefixed with a tilde. The reserved names are:
 *       CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, 
 *       COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.
 *       And remember, Windows is case-insensitive. 
 *     </li> 
 *   </ul>
 *   Examples:
 *   <br/><code>ark:/13030/xt12t3</code> becomes 
 *        <code>ark/+=1/303/0=x/t12/t3</code>
 *   <br/><code>http://n2t.info/urn:nbn:se:kb:repos-1</code> becomes 
 *        <code>htt/p+=/=n2/t,i/nfo/=ur/n+n/bn+/se+/kb+/rep/os-/1</code>
 *   <br/><code>what-the-*@?#!^!~?</code> becomes 
 *        <code>wha/t-t/he-/^2a/@^3/f#!/^5e/!^7/e^3/f</code>
 *   <br/><code>http://vivo.myDomain.edu/file/n3424</code> with namespace 
 *        <code>http://vivo.myDomain.edu/file/</code> and prefix 
 *        <code>a</code> becomes 
 *        <code>a~n/342/4</code>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Filename encoding</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 *   The name of the file is encoded as needed to guard against illegal 
 *   characters for the filesystem, but in practice we expect little encoding
 *   to be required, since few files are named with the special characters.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 *   The encoding process is the same as the "rare character encoding" and 
 *   "common character encoding" steps used for ID encoding, except that 
 *   periods are not encoded.
 * </p>
