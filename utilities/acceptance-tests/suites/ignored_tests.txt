# This is a list of tests that we don't expect to have pass. When they
# fail, they appear as warnings instead of errors.
#
# Each line contains the suite name, the test name, and an optional comment.
# Like this:
#     <suite name>, <test name> # Comment text
#
# If the test name is "*", then entire suite is ignored.
