            <!-- Release Announcement --><h2 id="announcement">Release anouncement for V1.2</h2>
            <p>
                The VIVO 1.2 release incorporates major changes throughout the application - 
				notably a new templating system to support more versatile page rendering, plus 
				improvements to address scalability. The release also features a new personal 
				visualization option covering grants as well as publications. The VIVO Harvester 
				library has also been significantly improved and expanded in scope for its 1.0 
				release through the VIVO SourceForge project at 
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo">http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Templating system for page generation, navigation, and theming</h4>
            <p>
                A fresh installation of VIVO 1.2 looks strikingly different, with the introduction 
				of a new default theme which takes advantage of the navigation and browse features 
				delivered by the templating system. Individual pages now offer inline navigation to 
				streamline viewing of expanded personal and organizational profiles, as well as 
				improved content layout and organization. New browse controls on the home page and 
				menu pages help to provide an immediate overview of the size and range of content 
				and quick access down to the individual person, organization, research feature, or 
				event.
            </p>
            <h4>Storage model</h4>
            <p>
                While server memory capacity has increased significantly in recent years, VIVO's reliance 
				on in-memory caching of RDF data had put limits on the ultimate scalability of VIVO instances 
				and potentially increased the cost of servers required to support VIVO.
            </p>
            <p>
                With version 1.2, VIVO has been converted to optionally use Jena's SPARQL database (SDB) 
				subsystem. SDB significantly reduces the baseline memory footprint, allowing VIVO installations 
				to scale well beyond what has previously been possible.
            </p>
            <h4>New visualizations</h4>
            <p>
                Visualizations of networks of co-authors are now complemented by visualizations of co-investigators 
				on grants, with similar interactivity and options for export as images or data.
            </p>
            <h4>Ontology</h4>
            <p>
                VIVO 1.2 includes a new ontology module representing research 
                resources including biological specimens, human studies, instruments,  
                organisms, protocols, reagents, and research opportunities. This module 
                is aligned with the top-level ontology classes and properties from the  
                NIH-funded <a href="https://www.eagle-i.org/home/">eagle-i Project</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Associated VIVO releases</h3>
            <h4>VIVO Harvester</h4>
            <p>
                The Harvester development team is releasing version 1.0 of the VIVO Harvester library shortly 
				following the release of VIVO 1.2. The Harvester is an extensible data ingest and updating 
				framework with sample configurations for loading PubMed publication, grants, and human resources 
				data. Pre-release versions of the Harvester are available at 
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo">http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo</a>.

            <p>
                Please ensure that backups are created of the: 
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>
                    Tomcat webapps directory 
                </li>

                    MySQL database (mysqldump) 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The upgrade process is similar to the original install process with 
                the following EXCEPTIONS: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    DO NOT reinstall MySQL or recreate the MySQL database. Please 
                    ensure that you back-up the MySQL database. Also note that VIVO 1.2 will  
                    not run on older versions of MySQL that may have worked with 1.1.1. 
                    Be sure to run VIVO 1.2 with MySQL 5.1 or higher.  Using unsupported  
                    versions may result in strange error messages related to table formatting or 
                    other unexpected problems.

                    First-time login of the administrator account after the upgrade 
                    process is complete will use the password previously set, NOT the  
                    default password used on the first login after the initial 
                    installation.

                <li>
                    The first time Apache Tomcat starts up after the upgrade, it 
                    will initiate a process that modifies the knowledge base to align the  
                    data with the revised ontology. See the section on the <a href="#ontology">Ontology Upgrade</a>
                    below for more information. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="triple_store">II. Choose Triple Store</h3>
            <p>
                VIVO 1.2 offers a choice of two triple store technologies: in-memory models backed by 
                Jena's legacy relational database store (RDB), and Jena's SPARQL database (SDB).   RDB was  
                used by VIVO 1.1.1 and earlier.   This mode offers fast response, but only by caching the 
                entire RDF model in the server's main memory.   The memory available to VIVO limits the 
                number of RDF statements that may be stored.
            </p>
            <p>
                SDB mode caches only a fraction of the RDF data in memory.  Most queries are issued directly 
                against the underlying database.  This allows VIVO installations to display data from large  
                RDF models while requiring only a small amount of server memory to run the application. 
                There is a tradeoff in response time:  pages make take slightly longer to load in SDB mode,  
                and performance will depend on the configuration parameters of the database server. 
                Additionally, advanced OWL reasoning (not enabled by default in either mode) is not possible  
                in SDB mode.  With SDB, only the default set of inferences (inferred rdf:type statements) are 
                generated, though they are generated as soon as data is edited rather than in a background process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though a VIVO installation may be switched back and forth between RDB and SDB mode by changing 
                a configuration property and redeploying the application, it is important to note that data  
                added in one mode will not typically appear in the other.  The exception is when a system is 
                first switched from RDB mode to SDB mode.  In this case, the data from the RDB store will be  
                automatically migrated to SDB. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A VIVO 1.2 system that is upgraded from VIVO 1.1.1 must initially be run in RDB mode in order 
                to receive required ontology updates.  Attempting to run an upgraded system initially in SDB will  
                result in a logged error message, and the application will not start.  After the system starts 
                up successfully the first time in RDB mode, it may then be switched to SDB, redeployed, and restarted. 
                Upon restart, the data in the RDB store will be copied to the SDB store.
            </p>
            <p>
                This copying process can take a number of hours to complete if the installation contains a large 
                amount of RDF data (roughly a million triples or more).  See section <a href="#setup_sdb">Set Up SDB Store in the Background (Optional)</a>
                for instructions on how 
                to run this lengthy conversion process in the background while an RDB system is operating. 
                Doing this will reduce the time necessary to start VIVO the first time it is run in SDB mode.
            </p>

                Changes to the VIVO core ontology may require corresponding

                extensions.

            <p>
                When Apache Tomcat starts up following the upgrade, it will initiate a
                process to examine the knowledge base and apply necessary changes. Not
                all of the modifications that may be required can be automated, so
                manual review of the knowledge base is recommended after the automated
                upgrade process. The automated process will make only the following
                types of changes:

                    All statements using a deleted property will be changed to use the
                    nearest available superproperty. If there is no available superproperty
                    then the statement will be deleted from the knowledge base. Note that

                Each uploaded file exists as an individual in VIVO. When the browser 
                requests an uploaded file from VIVO, the data model is queried to find  
                out where the file is actually stored, so it can be downloaded to the 
                browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                In VIVO 1.2 this storage location, known as the "Alias URL" for 
                the uploaded file, is stored in the file individual. That way, pages that 
                contain many files can be displayed much more quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Apache Tomcat starts up after the upgrade, 
                it will initiate a process to calculate the "Alias URL" 
                for each existing file and store it in the data model for fast access.

                <p>
                    Since vivo-basic was the default theme for all previous releases, it is 
                    included as part of VIVO 1.2 to help with the transition of upgrading  
                    existing installations to the latest code, but all vivo-basic development 
                    has ceased and it will not be distributed in future releases.

                    Please note that vivo-basic does not support all of the new 1.2 features. 
                    Most notably, in choosing to use vivo-basic you will be missing out on the

            <p>
                The 1.2 release continues the transition from JavaServer Pages (.jsp) to 
                Freemarker templates (.ftl) for generating web pages. While there are still  
                JSP files in action behind the scenes, as of 1.2 all theme templates 
                are of the Freemarker variety and are located in the "templates" directory 
                within a theme.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you did not create a custom theme for your site previously, but used 
                the vivo-basic theme in its original directory, you need not take any 
                action in order to remain using the vivo-basic theme in 1.2.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you did make changes to the vivo-basic theme, you will need to reapply those changes. 
                We recommend you apply these changes to the wilma theme.

                If your VIVO installation is running in RDB mode, and you'd like to convert 
                to SDB, you can start the conversion process in the background while the RDB  
                system is running.  This will reduce the delay in initial startup after the 
                application is redeployed with deploy.properties set for SDB.  Note that it  
                is important not to edit any data anywhere in the application while this

                http://vivo.myuniversity.edu/sdbsetup into your browser).
            </p>
            <p>
                Click the button that appears on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the course of the SDB setup, which may take several hours on a 
                large database, subsequent requests to /sdbsetup will display a 
                message that the operation is still in progress.   When a request for this  
                page shows a message that the SDB setup has completed successfully, shut down 
                Tomcat, set deploy.properties to SDB mode, redeploy, and restart Tomcat. 
                VIVO will now be running from the SDB store.
