            <!-- Release Announcement --><h2 id="announcement">Release anouncement for V1.2  (February 16, 2011)</h2>
            <p>
                The VIVO 1.2 release incorporates major changes throughout the application - 
				notably a new templating system to support more versatile page rendering, plus 
				improvements to address scalability. The release also features a new personal 
				visualization option covering grants as well as publications. The VIVO Harvester 
				library has also been significantly improved and expanded in scope for its 1.0 
				release through the VIVO SourceForge project at 
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo">http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Templating system for page generation, navigation, and theming</h4>
            <p>
                A fresh installation of VIVO 1.2 looks strikingly different, with the introduction 
				of a new default theme which takes advantage of the navigation and browse features 
				delivered by the templating system. Individual pages now offer inline navigation to 
				streamline viewing of expanded personal and organizational profiles, as well as 
				improved content layout and organization. New browse controls on the home page and 
				menu pages help to provide an immediate overview of the size and range of content 
				and quick access down to the individual person, organization, research feature, or 
				event.
            </p>
            <h4>Storage model</h4>
            <p>
                While server memory capacity has increased significantly in recent years, VIVO's reliance 
				on in-memory caching of RDF data had put limits on the ultimate scalability of VIVO instances 
				and potentially increased the cost of servers required to support VIVO.
            </p>
            <p>
                With version 1.2, VIVO has been converted to optionally use Jena's SPARQL database (SDB) 
				subsystem. SDB significantly reduces the baseline memory footprint, allowing VIVO installations 
				to scale well beyond what has previously been possible.
            </p>
            <h4>New visualizations</h4>
            <p>
                Visualizations of networks of co-authors are now complemented by visualizations of co-investigators 
				on grants, with similar interactivity and options for export as images or data.
            </p>
            <h4>Ontology</h4>
            <p>
                VIVO 1.2 includes a new ontology module representing research 
                resources including biological specimens, human studies, instruments,  
                organisms, protocols, reagents, and research opportunities. This module 
                is aligned with the top-level ontology classes and properties from the  
                NIH-funded <a href="https://www.eagle-i.org/home/">eagle-i Project</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Associated VIVO releases</h3>
            <h4>VIVO Harvester</h4>
            <p>
                The Harvester development team is releasing version 1.0 of the VIVO Harvester library shortly 
				following the release of VIVO 1.2. The Harvester is an extensible data ingest and updating 
				framework with sample configurations for loading PubMed publication, grants, and human resources 
				data. Pre-release versions of the Harvester are available at 
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo">http://sourceforge.net/projects/vivo</a>.

                Before installing VIVO, make sure that the following software is 
                installed on the desired machine: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Java (SE) 1.6 or higher, <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>

                    Apache Tomcat 6.x or higher, <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">http://tomcat.apache.org</a>
                </li>

                    Apache Ant 1.7 or higher, <a href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    MySQL 5.1 or higher*, <a href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Be sure to set up the environment variables for <code java_home="">JAVA_HOME</code>
                and <code>ANT_HOME</code>
                and add the executables to your path per 
                your operating system and installation directions from the software  
                support websites. 
            </p>
            <p>
                * Note that VIVO 1.2+ will not run on older versions of MySQL that may have worked 
                with 1.1.1.  Be sure to run VIVO 1.2+ with MySQL 5.1 or higher.  Using unsupported  
                versions may result in strange error messages related to table formatting or other 
                unexpected problems.
            </p>
            <h3 id="create_database">II. Create an empty MySQL database </h3>
            <p>
                Decide on a database name, username, and password. Log into your 
                MySQL server and create a new database in MySQL that uses <code>UTF-8
                    encoding</code>. You will need these values for Step IV when you 
                configure the deployment properties. At the MySQL command line you can  
                create the database and user with these commands substituting your 
                values for <code>dbname</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>password</code>. 
                Most  
                of 
                the time, the hostname will equal <code>localhost</code>. 
            </p>
            <pre>                CREATE DATABASE dbname CHARACTER SET utf8;<br></pre>
            <p>
                Grant access to a database user. For example: 
            </p>
            <pre>                GRANT ALL ON dbname.* TO 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';<br></pre>
            <p>
                Keep track of the database name, username, and password for Step 
                IV. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="download_code">III. Download the VIVO Application Source

                Download the VIVO application source as either <code>rel-1.2.1.zip</code>
                or <code>rel-1.2.1.gz</code>
                file and unpack it on your web server:

            <h3 id="triple_store">IV. Choose Triple Store</h3>
            <p>
                VIVO 1.2+ offers a choice of two triple store technologies: in-memory models backed by 
                Jena's legacy relational database store (RDB), and Jena's SPARQL database (SDB).   RDB was  
                used by VIVO 1.1.1 and earlier.   This mode offers fast response, but only by caching the 
                entire RDF model in the server's main memory.   The memory available to VIVO limits the 
                number of RDF statements that may be stored.
            </p>
            <p>
                SDB mode caches only a fraction of the RDF data in memory.  Most queries are issued directly 
                against the underlying database.  This allows VIVO installations to display data from large  
                RDF models while requiring only a small amount of server memory to run the application. 
                There is a tradeoff in response time:  pages make take slightly longer to load in SDB mode,  
                and performance will depend on the configuration parameters of the database server. 
                Additionally, advanced OWL reasoning (not enabled by default in either mode) is not possible  
                in SDB mode.  With SDB, only the default set of inferences (inferred rdf:type statements) are 
                generated, though they are generated as soon as data is edited rather than in a background process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though a VIVO installation may be switched back and forth between RDB and SDB mode by changing 
                a configuration property and redeploying the application, it is important to note that data  
                added in one mode will not typically appear in the other.  The exception is when a system is 
                first switched from RDB mode to SDB mode.  In this case, the data from the RDB store will be  
                automatically migrated to SDB. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="deploy_properties">V. Specify deployment properties </h3>
            <p>
                At the top level of the unpacked distribution, copy the file <code>example.deploy.properties</code>
                to a file named simply <code>deploy.properties</code>. This file sets 
                several properties used in compilation and deployment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Windows:</em>
                For those installing on Windows operating 
                system, include the windows drive and use the forward slash "/" and not  
                the back slash "\" in the directory locations, e.g. <code>c:/tomcat</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>External authentication:</em>
                If you want to use an external 
                authentication system like Shibboleth or CUWebAuth, you will need to  
                set two additional properties in this file. See the section below

                            the client. To make this possible, VIVO's default namespace must have

                            In the meantime, VIVO release 1.2+ guards against this impact by disabling  
                            the temporal graph visualization unless the "visualization.temporal" flag 
                            is set to "enabled". To enable it, uncomment the line for this setting.

                            parameters like number of publications or grants. By default, the app

                At the command line, from the top level of the unpacked 
                distribution directory, type: 
            </p>

            </p>
            <h3 id="tomcat_settings">VII. Set Tomcat JVM parameters and security
                limits</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, VIVO copies the contents of your RDF database into 
                memory in order to serve Web requests quickly (the in-memory copy and  
                the underlying database are kept in synch as edits are performed). 
            </p>
            <p>
                VIVO will require more memory than that allocated to Tomcat by 
                default. With most installations of Tomcat, the "setenv.sh" or  
                "setenv.bat" file in Tomcat's bin directory is a convenient place to 
                set the memory parameters. 
                <br>
                For example: 
            </p>
            <pre>                    export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"<br>                </pre>
            <p>
                This sets Tomcat to allocate an initial heap of 2048 megabytes, a 
                maximum heap of 1024 megabytes, and a PermGen space of 128 megs. 1024  
                megabytes is a minimum practical heap size for production installations 
                storing data for large academic institutions, and additional heap space  
                is preferable. For testing with small sets of data, 256m to 512m should 
                be sufficient. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If an OutOfMemoryError is encountered during VIVO execution, it can 
                be remedied by increasing the heap parameters and restarting Tomcat. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Security limits: VIVO is a multithreaded web application that may 
                require more threads than are permitted under your Linux installation's  
                default configuration. Ensure that your installation can support the 
                required number of threads by making the following edits to <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code>:
            </p>
            <pre>                    apache	hard	nproc	400<br>                    tomcat6	hard	nproc	1500 <br>                </pre>
            <h3 id="start_tomcat">VIII. Start Tomcat </h3>
            <p>
                Most Tomcat installations can be started by running <code>startup.sh</code>
                or <code>startup.bat</code>
                in Tomcat's bin directory. Point your 
                browser to "http://localhost:8080/vivo/" to test the application. If  
                Tomcat does not start up, or the VIVO application is not visible, check 
                the <code>catalina.out</code>
                file in Tomcat's logs directory. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="add_rdf">IX. Log in and add RDF data </h3>
            <p>
                If the startup was successful, you will see a welcome message 
                informing you that you have successfully installed VIVO. Click the "Log  
                in" link near the upper right corner. Log in with the <code>initialAdminUser</code>
                username you set up in Step IV. The initial password for the <code>initialAdminUser</code>
                account is "defaultAdmin" (without the quotes). On first login, you 
                will be prompted to select a new password and verify it a second time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After verifying your new password, you will be presented with a 
                menu of editing options. Here you can create OWL classes, object  
                properties, data properties, and configure the display of data. 
                Currently, any classes you wish to make visible on your website must be  
                part of a class group, and there are a number of visibility and display 
                options available for each ontology entity. VIVO comes with a core VIVO  
                ontology, but you may also upload other ontologies from an RDF file. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the "Advanced Data Tools" click "Add/Remove RDF Data." Note 
                that Vitro currently works best with OWL-DL ontologies and has only  
                limited support for pure RDF data. You can enter a URL pointing to the 
                RDF data you wish to load or upload from a file on your local machine.  
                Ensure that the "add RDF" radio button is selected. You will also 
                likely want to check "create classgroups automatically." 
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking the "Index" tab in the navigation bar at the top right of 
                the page will show a simple index of the knowledge base.

                If you have configured your application to use the "Contact Us"
                feature in Step IV (<code>Vitro.smtpHost</code>), you will also need to 
                add an email address to the VIVO application.&nbsp; This is the email

            <h3 id="tomcat_connector">XI. Set up Apache Tomcat Connector </h3>
            <p>
                It is recommended that a Tomcat Connector such as mod_jk be used to 
                ensure that the site address does not include the port number (e.g.  
                8080) and an additional reference to the Tomcat context name (e.g. 
                /vivo). 
            </p>
            <p>
                This will make VIVO available at "http://example.com" instead of 
                "http://example.com:8080/vivo" 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the mod_jk connector allows for communication between Tomcat 
                and the primary web server. The <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/generic_howto/quick.html">Quick
                    Start
                    HowTo</a>
                on the Apache site describes the minimum server 
                configurations for several popular web servers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After setting up the mod_jk connector above, you will need to 
                modify the Tomcat's server.xml (located in <code>[tomcat root]/conf/</code>) 
                to  
                respond 
                to requests from Apache via the connector. Look for the  
                &lt;connector&gt; directive and add the following properties: 
            </p>
            <pre>                connectionTimeout="20000" maxThreads="320" keepAliveTimeout="20000"&nbsp; <br>            </pre>
            <p>
                Note: the value for maxThreads (320) is equal to the value for 
                MaxClients in the apache's <code>httpd.conf</code>
                file. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Locate the <code>&lt;Host name="localhost"...&gt;</code>
                directive 
                and update as follows: 
            </p>
            <pre>	    
			&lt;Host name="localhost" appBase="webapps"<br>

			</pre>
            <h3 id="pellet">XII. Configure Pellet Reasoner </h3>
            <p>
                This optional configuration step is only applicable to VIVO installations 
                running in RDB mode (See section <a href="triple_store">Choose Triple Store</a>
                for details). 
                VIVO uses the Pellet engine to perform reasoning, which runs in the  
                background at startup and also when the knowledge base is edited. VIVO 
                continues serving pages while the reasoner continues working; when the  
                reasoner finishes, the new inferences appear. Inferred statements are 
                cached in a database graph so that they are available immediately when  
                VIVO is restarted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, Pellet is fed only an incomplete view of your ontology 
                and only certain inferences are materialized. These include rdf:type,  
                rdfs:subClassOf, owl:equivalentClass, and owl:disjointWith. This mode 
                is typically suitable for ontologies with a lot of instance data. If  
                you would like to keep the default mode, skip to the next step. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To enable "complete" OWL inference (materialize all significant 
                entailed statements), open "vitro-core/webapp/config/web.xml" and  
                search for PelletReasonerSetup. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Then change the name of the listener class to 
                PelletReasonerSetupComplete. Because "complete" reasoning can be very  
                resource intensive, there is also an option to materialize nearly all 
                inferences except owl:sameAs and owl:differentFrom. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is enabled by specifying PelletReasonerSetupPseudocomplete. 
                For ontologies with large numbers of individuals, this mode can offer  
                enormous performance improvements over the "complete" mode. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, a class called 
                PelletReasonerSetupPseudocompleteIgnoreDataproperties is provided to  
                improve performance on ontologies with large literals where data 
                property entailments are not needed.

            <h3 id="external_auth">XIII. Using an External Authentication System 
                with VIVO </h3>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
                VIVO can be configured to work with an external authentication 
                system like Shibboleth or CUWebAuth. 
            </p>
            <p>
                VIVO must be accessible only through an Apache HTTP server. The 
                Apache server will be configured to invoke the external authentication  
                system. When the user completes the authentication, the Apache server 
                will pass a network ID to VIVO, to identify the user. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If VIVO has an account for that user, the user will be logged in 
                with the privileges of that account. In the absence of an account, VIVO  
                will try to find a page associated with the user. If such a page is 
                found, the user can log in to edit his own profile information. 
            </p>
            <h4>Configuring the Apache server</h4>
            <p>
                Your institution will provide you with instructions for setting up
                the external authentication system. The Apache server must be
                configured to secure a page in VIVO. When a user reaches this secured
                page, the Apache server will invoke the external authentication system.
            </p>
            <p>
                For VIVO, this secured page is named: <code>/loginExternalAuthReturn</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                When your instructions call for the location of the secured page, 
                this is the value you should use. 
            </p>
            <h4>Configuring VIVO</h4>
            <p>
                To enable external authentication, VIVO requires three values in 
                the <code>deploy.properties</code>
                file. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h5>The name of the HTTP header that will hold the external user's
                        network ID.</h5>
                    <p>
                        When a user completes the authentication process, the Apache server
                        will put the user's network ID into one of the headers of the HTTP
                        request. The instructions from your institution should tell you which
                        header is used for this purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You need to tell VIVO the name of that HTTP header. Insert a 
                        line like this in the deploy.properties file:
                    </p>
                    <pre>externalAuth.netIdHeaderName = [the header name]</pre>
                    <p>
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>externalAuth.netIdHeaderName = remote_userID</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>The text for the Login button.</h5>
                    To start the authentication process, the user will click on a button in
                    the VIVO login form. You need to tell VIVO what text should appear in
                    that button.
                    <p>
                        Put a line like this in the deploy.properties file:
                        externalAuth.buttonText = [the text for your login button] For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>externalAuth.buttonText = Log in using BearCat Shibboleth</pre>
                    <p>
                        The VIVO login form will display a button labelled "Log in using 
                        BearCat Shibboleth". 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Associating a User with a profile page.</h5>
                    <p>
                        If VIVO has an account for the user, the user will be given the
                        privileges assigned to that account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, VIVO will try to associate the user with a profile 
                        page, so the user may edit his own profile data. VIVO will search the  
                        data model for a person with a property that matches the User’s network 
                        ID. You need to tell VIVO what property should be used for matching.  
                        Insert a line like this in the deploy.properties file: 
                    </p>
                    <pre>selfEditing.idMatchingProperty = [the URI of the property]</pre>
                    <p>
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>selfEditing.idMatchingProperty = http://vivo.mydomain.edu/ns#networkId</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="installation_check">XIV. Was the installation successful? </h3>
            <p>
                If you have completed the previous steps, you have good indications 
                that the installation was successful. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Step VII showed that Tomcat recognized the webapp, and that the 
                    webapp was able to present the initial page. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step VIII verified that you can log in to the administrator 
                    account. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here is a simple test to see whether the ontology files were 
                loaded: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click on the "Index" link on the upper right, below the logo. 
                    You should see a "locations" section, with links for "Country" and  
                    "Geographic Location." The index is built in a background thread, so on 
                    your first login, you may see an empty index instead. Refresh the page  
                    periodically to see whether the index will be populated. This may take 
                    some time: with VIVO installed on a modest laptop computer, loading the  
                    ontology files and building the index took more than 5 minutes from the 
                    time that Tomcat was started. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the "Country" link. You should see an alphabetical list 
                    of the countries of the world. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here is a test to see whether your system is configured to serve 
                linked data: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Point your browser to the home page of your website, and click 
                    the "Log in" link near the upper right corner. Log in with the <code>initialAdminUser</code>
                    username you set up in Step IV. If this is your first time logging in, 
                    you will be prompted to change the password. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    After you have successfully logged in, click "site admin" in the 
                    upper right corner. In the drop down under "Data Input" select "Faculty  
                    Member(core)" and click the "Add individual of this class" button. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter the name "test individual" under the field "Individual 
                    Name," scroll to the bottom, and click "Create New Record." You will be  
                    taken to the "Individual Control Panel." Make note of the value of the 
                    field "URI" - it will be used in the next step. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open a new web browser or browser tab to the page <a href="http://marbles.sourceforge.net/">http://marbles.sourceforge.net/</a>. 
                    In  
                    the 
                    pink box on that page enter the URI of the individual you  
                    created in the previous step and click "open." 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the resulting page search for the URI of the "test 
                    individual." You should find it towards the bottom of the page next to  
                    a red dot followed by "redirect (303)." This indicates that you are 
                    successfully serving linked RDF data. If the URI of the "test  
                    individual" is followed by "failed (400)" you are not successfully 
                    serving linked data. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Finally, test the search index. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Type the word "Australia" into the search box, and click on the 
                    Search button.You should see a page of results, with links to countries  
                    that border Australia, individuals that include Australia, and to 
                    Australia itself. To trigger the search index, you can log in as a site  
                    administrator and go to "http://your-vivo-url/SearchIndex".
