Instructions for VIVO developers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are working from the VIVO distribution files, you should follow the 
instructions in "install.txt", in this directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are working from the VIVO source files, checked out from the Subversion
repository, then your working area does not contain the "vitro-core" directory.

Follow these steps:

  1) In the VIVO working area, create deploy.properties as a copy of 
     example.deploy.properties
     
  2) Check out the Vitro source files from Subversion into a separate working 
     area.

  3) Modify deploy.properties (created in step 1) so vitro.core.dir points to
     the Vitro working area (created in step 2). For example:
        vitro.core.dir = ../vitro
        
  4) Follow the instructions in "install.txt" to complete the installation, 
     omitting step III.

Answers to Frequently Asked Questions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I'm running VIVO in Tomcat on a MacIntosh. When I upload an image file, a 
   strange icon appears in the dock. What's up with that?
   
A: The image processing code in VIVO uses javax.imageio.ImageIO, which in turn
   uses code in the java.awt package. By default, this package will open a work
   area on your screen, producing this icon even though no visible window is
   created.
   
   You can prevent this by editing {tomcat}/conf/setenv.sh, and adding the 
   "java.awt.headless" option. For example,
       export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=64m -Djava.awt.headless=true"
