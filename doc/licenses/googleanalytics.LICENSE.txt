GOOGLE ANALYTICS LICENSE

The following are the terms and conditions for use of the Google Analytics service described herein (the "Service") between Google Inc. and you (either an individual or a legal entity that you represent as an authorized employee or agent) ("You"). Please read them carefully. BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AND/OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ARE STATING THAT YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AN ACCOUNT AND THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SERVICE ("AGREEMENT"). The Service is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Account" refers to the billing account for the Service. All Profiles linked to a single Site will have their Page Views aggregated prior to determining the charge for the Service for that Site.

"Customer Data" means the data concerning the characteristics and activities of visitors to your website that is collected through use of the UTM and then forwarded to the Servers and analyzed by the Processing Software.

"Documentation" means any accompanying proprietary documentation made available to You by Google for use with the Processing Software, including any documentation available online or otherwise.

"Page View" is the unit of measurement for usage of the Service. A Page View is used when the UTM is executed on a web page accessed by a visitor, and processed as part of a Profile. A Page View will be incurred for each instance of the UTM on the web page, and for each Profile receiving information from the UTM for such web page.

"Processing Software" means the proprietary Google Analytics Software and any all upgrades to such, which analyzes the Customer Data and generates the Reports.

"Profile" means the collection of settings that together determine the information to be included in, or excluded from, a particular Report. For example, a Profile could be established to view a small portion of a web site as a unique Report. There can be multiple Profiles established under a single Site.

"Report" means the resulting analysis shown at www.google.com/analytics (or such other URL Google may provide from time to time) for an individual profile. The number of charts, graphs, and statistics contained in a Report varies with the edition of the Service.

"UTM" means the proprietary Google Analytics Tracking Code, which is installed on a web page for the purpose of collecting Customer Data, together with any fixes, updates and upgrades provided to you (collectively, the "UTM").

"Servers" means the servers controlled by Google (or its wholly owned subsidiaries) upon which the Processing Software and Customer Data are stored.

"Site" means a group of web pages that are linked to an Account and use the same UTM. Each Site consists of a default Profile that measures all pages within the Site. Additional Profiles can be established under a Site to evaluate subsections of a Site in greater detail.

"Software" means the UTM and the Processing Software.

2. FEES AND SERVICES . Subject to Section 15 herein, the Service is provided without charge to You for up to 5 million pageviews per month per account, and if You have an active Adwords campaign in good standing, the Service is provided without charge to You without a pageview limitation.
